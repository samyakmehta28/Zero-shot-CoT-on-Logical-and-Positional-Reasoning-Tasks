Arpit and Vivek are the immediate neighbours of Sachin. Rajan is 4th to the left of the person who is in front of Aman. Aman is 2nd to the left of Rohit.

Gaur neither sits at corner nor opposite to Shera. Nora sits third to the left of Rani. Only two persons sit between Mrig and Shera, who sits immediate left of Nora. Anup sits second to the left of Heer, who sits third left of Gaur. Who among the following sits third to the left of Doha?
